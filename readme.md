# Description

At one time, my github repository was full of forked repositories. I used to fork interesting repositories with the hope of reading or contributing on those repos later. But, there are so many things to do that I never got the time around to get back to those forked repositories. Because of this clutter, I could not even find my own repositories.

So, I decided to clean my github account and remove those forked repositories. I may fork new repositories again, but then whenever my space will become crowded, I will run this script to clean up.
